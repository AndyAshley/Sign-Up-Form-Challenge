## Overview

This is my 12th challenge from [Front-end-mentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io/). It was to code and style an intro component with a sign up form based on the design assets provided. (static **JPG** images)

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"[Field Name] cannot be empty"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Looks like this is not an email"_
